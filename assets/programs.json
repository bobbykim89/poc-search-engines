    "longDescription": "<p>The science of complex systems is a study of interactions. It is the interactions among our cells that enables them to collectively form an individual, the interactions among diverse plants and animals that produce a rich ecosystem. A complexity scientist studies these interactions, among genes, cells, species and people.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=\"h2-small mb-space-xs\">What are complex adaptive systems?</h2><p>We are surrounded by systems that are essential to our life and well being. Living organisms, ecosystems, corporations, societies, cities and even our bodies are complex adaptive systems. Complex systems are formed when different types of components interact in networks to create a whole that is greater than the sum of its parts. In our bodies, skin cells, blood cells, nerve cells, bone cells and other kinds of cells all interact to form an individual who does not behave like any of the cells they are made from. Plant and animal species interact as predators or prey to cycle nutrients and inhibit or encourage each other's growth in an ecosystem. Individuals, neighborhoods, businesses, utilities and local governments interact in cities.</p><p>Complex adaptive systems are organized as groups of components nested within components. In our bodies, different kinds of bone cells are organized into individual bones, which are organized in our skeletal system. The components of complex adaptive systems also transmit and process information, like the nervous system and immune system in our bodies. This enables complex adaptive systems to grow, evolve, adapt and die. Complex systems are at the core of all real-world challenges, ranging from health care and sustainability to engineering, economics and social systems. Learning about the interactions that create complex adaptive systems is key to understanding our world and creating solutions to our most pressing issues.</p><p>In a complex adaptive system, the interactions among components within components are many and diverse. Complex adaptive system scientists use advanced information technologies like network science and computational modeling to help them understand how these interactions create emergent properties and enable complex adaptive systems to grow and adapt to a constantly changing environment.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p><h2 class=\"h2-small mb-space-xs\">What skills will I learn with a complex systems science master's degree?</h2><p>You’ll learn about the fundamental properties that underlie all complex adaptive systems and how interactions among system components determine how these systems grow and change. You’ll develop cutting-edge digital skills like modeling and network science that are needed to understand and manage complex adaptive systems. A master’s in complex system science will equip you with unique insights and tools for problem solving and critical thinking.</p><p>Even though complex adaptive systems are such an important part of our lives, few people yet have the knowledge and skills to understand the interactions needed to fully understand them. For this reason, complex systems science can help you develop innovative solutions in a wide range of areas, including sustainability, finance, social sciences, biomedical sciences, computer science, public policy, political science and psychology. This program’s unique subject matter gives you an edge over other job candidates and many of the skills developed in this program are foundational to a large number of employment opportunities.</p>",
